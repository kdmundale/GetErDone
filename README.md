Hello!!

GetErDone is a simple to-do app I'm creating as my first python project.
I've never been one to use to-do lists, but as my life becomes ever increasingly chaotic.... I'm beginning to see their real value!

## Installation

This project skeleton stores dependencies in `requirements.txt`. To install them run `pip install -r requirements.txt` while in an active virtual environment. You can add more with `pip install` and the package name, but don't forget to update the dependency list with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

You can run the tests with the `pytest` command. You can learn more about this command and how to write more tests at [pytest's website](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html).
